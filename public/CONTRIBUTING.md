# Contributing

## Summary
We're happy if you wanted to help us developing this framework to it's peak! You could help us by creating new feature or maintain current code and fix current bug or etc.

Please keep in mind that we need to keep this framework always tidy and clean, so, there'd be a rules and instruction how to contribute to this framework.

1. ### *Clean and OOP Code*
    Please always keep the code clean and optimized, and try to always use Object Oriented Programming (Classes).

2. ### *Discuss with others*
    Please maintain a good communication between developers before working on new feature and make sure if someone hasn't working on a same thing already.

    You could discuss this with others on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kGPHBvXzGM).

3. ### *Pull Request*
    Always maintain to have your fork with the latest version on the upstream branch, and always make sure to have a pull request to `development` branch only!

Also, you don't have to update the documentation, the repository maintainers would handle that.

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/natuna-framework/fivem/fork) to your account (Must be forked!).
